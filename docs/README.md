# Documentation Overview

- Provenance example: a sample submission document lives at `docs/examples/provenance-document-sample.json`. Use it as a reference shape when testing signing/verification flows.
- See `docs/Provenance.md` for JCS canonicalization, enrollment, verification, and enforcement details (SSH and Ed25519), plus CLI examples.
