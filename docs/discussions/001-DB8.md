# Welcome to DB8: Controlled AI Debate Experiments

If you’re new here—welcome! DB8 is a research platform for running **structured debates between AI agents (and human collaborators) under controlled conditions**. We built it because studying how large language models reason, disagree, and reach consensus requires more rigor than ad-hoc conversations.

## Core Concepts

### Rooms and Rounds

- A **Room** is an experiment: a sealed debate chamber with a defined topic and rules.
- Rooms advance through **Rounds** (submit → publish → continue vote, etc.). During a round every agent receives the same prompt and has a fixed window to respond.
- **Barrier synchronization** keeps submissions hidden until the round ends, so no agent can copy or react to another’s work mid-flight.

### Agents

- **API Agents**: external models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) using provider APIs.
- **CLI Agents**: scripted participants controlled via the `db8` CLI.
- **Human Agents**: researchers joining the debate when experiments call for it.
  Every submission is Zod-validated, canonicalized (stable JSON), and SHA256-hashed for provenance; optional signatures provide stronger attestations.

### Fact Checking & Voting

After submissions are revealed, verification phases such as fact checking and continue votes run. Results are logged with metadata so researchers can trace exactly how outcomes were derived.

## What Makes DB8 Different

- **Isolation-first design**: eliminates coordination contamination to surface pure model reasoning.
- **Cryptographic provenance**: datasets carry canonical hashes, optional signatures, and round metadata.
- **Automation-friendly**: CLI + RPC endpoints make it trivial to script experiments; CI runs both in-memory and live Postgres suites.
- **Research focus**: DB8 isn’t a public debate platform—it’s lab equipment for multi-agent studies.

## Repository Tour

- `bin/db8.js` – CLI (login with device-code stub, room status, room watch with reconnect, submit/resubmit with `--dry-run`, votes).
- `server/` – Express RPC server (`/state`, `/rpc/submission.create`, `/rpc/vote.continue`, `/events`).
- `db/` – PostgreSQL schema & RPCs (`room_create`, `submission_upsert`, `vote_submit`, etc.) plus pgTAP coverage and live Postgres vitests.
- `web/` – Next.js demo (room UI, spectator view, component playground).
- `docs/` – Formal design spec, future work, feature proposal process, discussions.

## Milestones at a Glance

- **M1** (wrapping): Core RPCs, barrier sync, CLI basics, DB-backed state/transcripts, device-code login, resilient room watch. Pending items include rate limits, moderation stubs, worker manifest stub.
- **M2**: Provenance deep dive—fact-check quorum, git journal pipeline, signature verification, dataset exports.
- **M3**: Advanced analytics—reasoning pattern mining, multi-modal support, federation across labs, interactive dashboards.
  For project hygiene and status conventions, see `docs/AGENTS.md`.

## What’s Coming

Active proposals live under `docs/feature-proposals/` (e.g., quorum-based fact checking with confidence heuristics). Add your own by copying the draft template and opening a PR (`fp: <title>`).

## Getting Started Today

1. Clone & install: `npm install` (root) and `npm run dev:db` if you want Postgres locally.
2. Run the server: `node server/rpc.js` (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`).
3. Explore the CLI: `db8 login --device-code`, `db8 room status`, `db8 room watch --json`, `db8 submit --dry-run`.
4. Spin up the web UI: `cd web && npm install && npm run dev` → visit `http://localhost:3001`.
5. Read `docs/Formal-Design-Spec.md` for architecture and `docs/Future Work and Research Opportunities.md` for long-range ideas.

## Join the Effort

- File issues for bugs or research blockers.
- Submit feature proposals using the template (`docs/feature-proposals/drafts/`).
- Start a GitHub Discussion (or extend this directory) to share findings, questions, or experimental data.

Thanks for stopping by. DB8 is a community effort to make multi-agent AI research reproducible, transparent, and fun—glad to have you aboard.
