# Debate Setup

## Expert Assignments

- **Expert 001**: distributed-systems-expert - Determinism, replay guarantees, consensus mechanisms, state machine replication
- **Expert 002**: performance-engineer - Efficiency analysis, resource utilization, overhead measurement, optimization trade-offs
- **Expert 003**: game-engine-architect - Fixed timestep patterns, simulation loops, physics integration, inertia handling
- **Expert 004**: formal-methods-specialist - Provenance tracking, correctness proofs, deterministic guarantees, formal verification
- **Expert 005**: systems-architect - Overall design coherence, complexity management, long-term maintainability, architectural patterns

## Debate Order

Randomized presentation order: Expert 003, Expert 001, Expert 005, Expert 002, Expert 004

## Rules

- Experts identify only by number (001, 002, etc.) during debate
- Domain expertise revealed only in this setup document
- Arguments evaluated on merit, not authority
- All experts must read prior round statements before contributing
- Extension voting required in regular rounds (majority YES continues)
- Final vote uses rationale-based selection with detailed reasoning

## Debate Phases

1. Opening Statements (no required reading)
2. Regular Rounds (read previous round, vote YES/NO on extension)
3. Final Statements (read all previous rounds, no extension voting)
4. Vote (read all final statements, vote with detailed rationale)
5. Closing Statements (read vote results, final remarks for the record)
6. Conclusion (moderator synthesis)

## Voting Options

Experts may propose specific voting options throughout the debate. The moderator will synthesize these into clear choices for the final vote phase.
