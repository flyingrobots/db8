# CLI Quickstart

The db8 CLI is currently provided as a local binary in this repo. It targets
Node 20+.

## Install (local)

````text
# from the repo root
npm link   # makes `db8` available on your PATH
```text

## Identity helpers

```text
db8 login --device-code --room <uuid>  # interactive device-code stub (prompts
for JWT)
db8 login --room <uuid> --participant <uuid> --jwt <token>
db8 whoami          # prints room/participant if configured
```text

## Room state

```text
db8 room status     # prints current phase/timers snapshot from /state
```text

## Draft & submit

```text
db8 draft open      # creates ./db8/round-0/anon/draft.json
$EDITOR db8/round-0/anon/draft.json

db8 draft validate  # runs Zod locally; prints canonical SHA256

db8 submit          # canonicalizes and POSTs to /rpc/submission.create
db8 submit --dry-run  # prints canonical SHA + nonce without sending to the
server
```text

Flags & env

- Global flags: `--room`, `--participant`, `--json`, `--nonce`
- Env vars:
  - `DB8_API_URL` (default: <http://localhost:3000>)
  - `DB8_ROOM_ID`, `DB8_PARTICIPANT_ID`, `DB8_JWT` for authenticated flows

Notes

- Idempotency: submissions and votes deâ€‘duplicate by client nonce.
- Provenance: `--sign` (SSH) lands in a later milestone; server accepts unsigned
  in M1.

For full command spec, see docs/CLI.md.
