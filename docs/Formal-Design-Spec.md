# DB8 - Multi-Agent Conversation Research Platform

## Formal Design Document

### Executive Summary

DB8 represents a novel approach to multi-agent AI coordination research. Rather
than attempting to fix human discourse, DB8 creates structured experimental
conditions for studying how different AI systems interact, reason, and reach
consensus under controlled circumstances. The platform treats conversation as a
distributed coordination problem, enabling researchers to generate reproducible
datasets of multi-AI reasoning patterns with cryptographic provenance
guarantees.

The system's core innovation lies in barrier synchronization, which eliminates
temporal coordination effects that plague traditional multi-agent conversations.
When Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini respond to identical prompts simultaneously
without seeing each other's intermediate reasoning, researchers can study pure
model differences rather than cascading influence effects.

## Terminology and Agent Classification

DB8 standardizes all participant references under the unified term **Agent**,
with clear subtypes reflecting different interaction modalities:

````mermaid

    class Agent {
        <<abstract>>
        +uuid id
        +string anon_name
        +timestamp joined_at
        +submit_response()
        +query_status()
    }

    class APIAgent {
        +string provider
        +jsonb model_config
        +string api_endpoint
        +verify_signature()
    }

    class CLIAgent {
        +string ssh_fingerprint
        +string executable_path
        +automated_workflow()
    }

    class HumanAgent {
        +string jwt_sub
        +boolean adaptive_timing
        +manual_interface()
    }

    class SystemAgent {
        +string function_role
        +boolean autonomous
        +process_evaluation()
    }

    Agent <|-- APIAgent
    Agent <|-- CLIAgent
    Agent <|-- HumanAgent
    Agent <|-- SystemAgent
```text

**API Agent**: AI system connected via provider APIs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini).
Primary function involves synchronized reasoning submission with cryptographic
verification.

**CLI Agent**: Programmatic participant using DB8 command-line tools. Enables
automated execution of research protocols through scriptable interfaces.

**Human Agent**: Researcher or subject participating in multi-agent
conversations. Operates under research protocol constraints with adaptive timing
accommodations.

**System Agent**: Automated internal components including fact-checkers and
moderators. Provides non-participatory evaluation and phase management services.

## Core Temporal Phases

DB8 operates through precisely defined temporal phases that ensure experimental
isolation:

**Isolation Period** (formerly Barrier Period): The time between synchronized
prompt distribution and submission deadline during which agents operate in
complete temporal isolation. Database constraints through Row-Level Security
policies strictly prevent accessing other participants' intermediate reasoning
or submitted content.

**Revelation Phase** (formerly Post-Barrier Phase): The period following atomic
publication of all accepted submissions. All responses become simultaneously
visible, enabling cross-evaluation, voting, and formal analysis activities
without temporal bias effects.

```mermaid

    }

    note right of IsolationPeriod : Agents cannot access other
    responses\nDatabase-level isolation enforced
    note right of RevelationPhase : All submissions visible
    simultaneously\nEnables clean comparative analysis
```text

### Attribution Control for Blind/Double-Blind Studies

DB8 not only controls when content is revealed; it also allows researchers to
decide how authorship is presented when the curtain finally lifts. During the
Revelation Phase, attribution can be configured so that submissions appear with
full author identity for downstream attribution analysis, or with a masked
identity that presents each contributor simply as an anonymous agent such as
“Agent 1” or “Agent 2.” In the masked mode the underlying provider information
is withheld, which lets teams study argument quality without brand or model bias
seeping into the evaluation. This behavior is governed by an
`experimental_parameters` field on the RoomConfig and directly shapes the
payload returned by `atomic_publish_all_responses()`. In effect, temporal
isolation removes coordination effects, while attribution control removes
identity effects, and together they produce cleaner experimental data.

## Problem Domain: Multi-AI Coordination Research

Contemporary AI research lacks adequate tools for studying inter-model dynamics.
Existing platforms like AutoGen focus on task completion rather than structured
analysis of reasoning patterns. Research teams conducting model comparisons
typically resort to sequential interviews or unstructured group conversations,
both of which introduce coordination artifacts that contaminate results.

The fundamental research challenge involves isolation of variables. When
studying how different AI systems approach reasoning tasks, researchers need to
separate intrinsic model characteristics from social influence effects.
Traditional conversation platforms fail here because participants can observe
and respond to each other's contributions in real-time, creating cascading
effects that obscure individual reasoning signatures.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Traditional Multi-AI Setup] --> B[Sequential Responses]
    A --> C[Visible Influence Chain]
    A --> D[Contaminated Data]

    E[DB8 Barrier Sync] --> F[Simultaneous Independent Responses]
    E --> G[Isolated Reasoning Patterns]
    E --> H[Clean Experimental Data]

    B --> I[Model A influences Model B influences Model C]
    F --> J[Model A, B, C respond independently to same prompt]

    style A fill:#ffcccc
    style E fill:#ccffcc
    style I fill:#ffcccc
    style J fill:#ccffcc
```text

DB8 addresses this through temporal isolation. All participants receive
identical prompts simultaneously but cannot observe other responses until the
isolation period expires. This creates experimental conditions similar to
double-blind studies in medical research, where the contaminating variable is
removed from the system entirely.

## System Architecture Philosophy

DB8 architecture reflects principles from distributed systems research rather
than social media design patterns. The system treats AI models as autonomous
agents requiring coordination protocols, not users requiring engagement
optimization.

```mermaid
C4Context
    title Multi-Agent Research Coordination Context

    Person(researcher, "AI Researcher", "Studies multi-model reasoning
    patterns")
    System_Boundary(db8, "DB8 Platform") {
        System(orchestrator, "Debate Orchestrator", "Coordinates agent timing
        and data collection")
        System(provenance, "Provenance Engine", "Ensures data integrity and
        attribution")
        System(analysis, "Analysis Pipeline", "Processes conversation datasets")
    }

    System_Ext(claude, "Claude API", "Anthropic's AI system")
    System_Ext(gpt4, "GPT-4 API", "OpenAI's AI system")
    System_Ext(gemini, "Gemini API", "Google's AI system")
    System_Ext(storage, "Git Journal", "Immutable dataset storage")

    Rel(researcher, orchestrator, "Configures experiments")
    Rel(orchestrator, claude, "Synchronized prompts")
    Rel(orchestrator, gpt4, "Synchronized prompts")
    Rel(orchestrator, gemini, "Synchronized prompts")
    Rel(provenance, storage, "Cryptographically signed results")
    Rel(analysis, storage, "Retrieves datasets for research")
```text

The orchestrator component serves as the temporal coordination mechanism,
ensuring that all AI participants receive prompts at precisely the same moment
and that responses remain isolated until the barrier period concludes. This
coordination happens through database-stored state machines and heartbeat
consensus protocols rather than session-based locking mechanisms.

## Critical Distributed Systems Resilience

The original design's reliance on PostgreSQL advisory locks for barrier
synchronization contained a critical architectural flaw. Session-based locks
create system failure scenarios where orchestrator crashes result in undefined
experimental states. DB8 now implements a distributed consensus protocol using
database-stored state machines.

### Orchestrator Heartbeat and Recovery Mechanism

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O1 as Primary Orchestrator
    participant O2 as Standby Orchestrator
    participant DB as Database
    participant A as Agents

    O1->>DB: acquire_barrier_lock(room_id, orchestrator_id)
    O1->>DB: update_heartbeat(room_id, timestamp)

    loop Heartbeat Monitoring
        O1->>DB: heartbeat_update()
        O2->>DB: check_heartbeat_status()
    end

    Note over O1: Orchestrator Failure
    O2->>DB: detect_stale_heartbeat()
    O2->>DB: execute_recovery_procedure()

    alt Barrier Period Expired
        O2->>DB: atomic_publish_round()
        O2->>A: barrier_complete_event()
    else Barrier Period Active
        O2->>DB: mark_round_failed()
        O2->>A: experiment_terminated_event()
    end
```text

The heartbeat mechanism requires active orchestrators to periodically update the
`last_heartbeat` column for their managed rooms. Standby orchestrators monitor
heartbeat freshness and execute recovery procedures when detecting orchestrator
failures.

```sql
-- Enhanced orchestrator heartbeat table
CREATE TABLE orchestrator_heartbeat (
  room_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  orchestrator_id uuid NOT NULL,
  lock_acquired_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  last_heartbeat timestamptz NOT NULL,
  expected_release_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  barrier_state jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);

-- Recovery procedure for failed orchestrator
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recover_abandoned_barrier()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  abandoned_room record;
BEGIN
  FOR abandoned_room IN
    SELECT * FROM orchestrator_heartbeat
    WHERE last_heartbeat < now() - interval '30 seconds'
  LOOP
    -- Determine if barrier period expired naturally
    IF abandoned_room.expected_release_at < now() THEN
      -- Proceed with atomic publication
      PERFORM atomic_publish_round(abandoned_room.room_id);
      INSERT INTO audit_log (event_type, room_id, details)
      VALUES ('barrier_recovered', abandoned_room.room_id, 'Automatic recovery
      after orchestrator failure');
    ELSE
      -- Mark round as failed due to orchestrator failure
      PERFORM mark_round_failed(abandoned_room.room_id, 'orchestrator_crash');
      INSERT INTO audit_log (event_type, room_id, details)
      VALUES ('barrier_failed', abandoned_room.room_id, 'Orchestrator failure
      during active barrier');
    END IF;

    -- Clean up heartbeat record
    DELETE FROM orchestrator_heartbeat WHERE room_id = abandoned_room.room_id;
  END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```text

This approach ensures that orchestrator failures cannot leave experiments in
undefined states. Recovery procedures either complete barrier periods that
expired naturally or explicitly fail experiments where orchestrator crashes
occurred during active barriers.

## Cryptographic Provenance and Integrity

Academic research requires stronger attribution guarantees than typical software
applications. DB8 implements JSON Canonicalization Scheme (RFC 8785) for
mathematically guaranteed content consistency and server-generated nonces for
replay attack prevention.

### JCS Canonicalization Standard

```javascript
// RFC 8785 compliant canonicalization
function canonicalizeJCS(value) {
  return JSON.stringify(value, (key, val) => {
    // Handle null values
    if (val === null || typeof val !== 'object') {
      return val;
    }

    // Preserve array order
    if (Array.isArray(val)) {
      return val;
    }

    // Sort object keys deterministically
    return Object.keys(val)
      .sort()
      .reduce((result, key) => {
        result[key] = val[key];
        return result;
      }, {});
  });
}

function sha256Hex(content) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(content, 'utf8').digest('hex');
}

// Usage in submission processing
const canonical = canonicalizeJCS({
  room_id: input.room_id,
  round_id: input.round_id,
  agent_id: input.agent_id,
  content: input.content,
  claims: input.claims,
  citations: input.citations,
  server_nonce: nonce.value
});

const content_hash = sha256Hex(canonical);
```text

This implementation provides mathematical guarantees that semantically
equivalent content yields identical hash values regardless of formatting
variations, object key ordering, or whitespace differences.

### Server-Generated Nonce Strategy

Client-generated nonces create security vulnerabilities where malicious agents
could replay previous submissions or coordinate timing attacks. DB8 implements
server-generated nonces that bind each submission to specific experimental
contexts.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant S as Server
    participant DB as Database

    A->>S: request_submission_nonce(room_id, round_id)
    S->>DB: generate_unique_nonce(agent_id, round_id)
    DB->>S: {nonce: "crypto-random", expires_at: timestamp}
    S->>A: submission_nonce_response(nonce, expires_at)

    Note over A: Agent prepares canonical submission with nonce

    A->>S: submit_reasoning(content, nonce, signature)
    S->>DB: validate_nonce_and_store(submission, nonce)

    alt Nonce Valid and Unexpired
        DB->>S: submission_accepted(id, hash)
        S->>A: success_response(submission_id, canonical_hash)
    else Nonce Invalid/Expired/Reused
        DB->>S: nonce_validation_error
        S->>A: error_response(invalid_nonce, details)
    end

    Note over DB: Nonce marked as consumed, cannot be reused
```text

Server-generated nonces include cryptographically random values with
time-limited validity periods. Each nonce can only be consumed once per agent
per round, preventing both accidental resubmission and malicious replay attacks.

### Standardized Error Codes for Automation

The platform’s RPC interface is designed for scripting, so operational failures
should be predictable rather than opaque. Instead of collapsing disparate
conditions into generic server errors, DB8 returns structured, recoverable codes
that automation can reason about. For example, a client may receive 409
NonceInvalid when a nonce has been consumed or expired, 423 BarrierLockFailure
when a coordination primitive cannot be acquired, 428 SubmissionDeadlineMissed
when a late submission arrives after enforcement, or 451 SignatureMismatch when
integrity checks fail. Pipelines can then codify deterministic behavior—log and
advance on a missed deadline, but abort and alert on a signature mismatch—so
experiments remain reproducible under automation.

## Research Methodology and Data Structuring

Research reproducibility requires structured data schemas that enable
quantitative analysis and meta-research studies. DB8 implements comprehensive
Zod validation for all research outputs.

### Analysis Pipeline Enhancements

The primary output of the system is a research-ready dataset, and the analysis
layer is shaped to minimize friction between the storage schema and the
questions investigators ask. To that end, DB8 provides a denormalized
round-level view, `ROUND_SUMMARY_V`, that captures the end-of-round state in a
single queryable surface. Each record presents the round identifier and
sequence, the agent identifier, the original reasoning content alongside its
canonical hash, an evidence-quality score derived from the voting schema, and
the fact-checking verdict attributed to that submission. By consolidating this
information, the view removes the need for error-prone joins across the core
tables when analysts merely want to understand what happened in a given round.

Equally important is the provenance of the evaluators themselves. Votes and
fact-check verdicts include the identity of the agent performing the evaluation,
but research frequently turns on the evaluator’s configuration—temperature,
model version, and provider—for API agents, or role and context for human
agents. The dataset export process therefore carries forward the evaluator’s
`model_configuration` (for API agents) or equivalent participant metadata so
that verdicts and scores can be examined through the lens of evaluator bias and
stability. This makes it straightforward to answer questions such as whether one
model family systematically penalizes another, or whether evaluation behavior
drifts as architectures evolve.

### Structured VOTES Entity Schema

```javascript
const ResearchVoteSchema = z.object({
  evaluation_scores: z.object({
    evidence_quality: z.number().min(0).max(10).describe('Quality and relevance
    of cited evidence'),
    reasoning_coherence: z
      .number()
      .min(0)
      .max(10)
      .describe('Logical consistency and argument structure'),
    citation_accuracy: z
      .number()
      .min(0)
      .max(10)
      .describe('Accuracy and appropriateness of citations'),
    argument_novelty: z
      .number()
      .min(0)
      .max(10)
      .describe('Originality and insight of reasoning approach'),
    response_completeness: z
      .number()
      .min(0)
      .max(10)
      .describe('Thoroughness in addressing prompt requirements')
  }),

  consensus_indicators: z.object({
    agreement_level: z
      .enum(['strong_agree', 'agree', 'neutral', 'disagree', 'strong_disagree'])
      .describe('Level of agreement with submission content'),
    confidence: z
      .number()
      .min(0)
      .max(1)
      .describe('Confidence in evaluation (0=uncertain, 1=certain)'),
    reasoning_similarity: z
      .number()
      .min(0)
      .max(1)
      .describe("Similarity to voter's own reasoning approach"),
    persuasion_effect: z
      .enum(['convinced', 'reinforced', 'neutral', 'skeptical'])
      .describe("Impact on voter's initial position")
  }),

  qualitative_assessment: z
    .string()
    .max(500)
    .optional()
    .describe('Optional detailed feedback on submission quality'),

  meta_evaluation: z
    .object({
      time_to_evaluate: z.number().min(0).describe('Time spent evaluating
      submission (seconds)'),
      evaluation_difficulty: z
        .number()
        .min(1)
        .max(5)
        .describe('Difficulty of evaluation task (1=easy, 5=very difficult)'),
      information_sufficiency: z
        .boolean()
        .describe('Whether submission provided sufficient information for
        evaluation')
    })
    .optional()
});
```text

This schema structure enables sophisticated research analysis including
inter-rater reliability studies, evaluation consistency metrics, and
longitudinal tracking of reasoning quality patterns across different AI systems.

### Adaptive Barrier Timing Configuration

Human agents require significantly longer processing time than AI systems for
equivalent reasoning tasks. DB8 implements adaptive timing that adjusts barrier
duration based on participant composition.

```javascript
const BarrierTimingConfig = z.object({
  ai_only_duration: z
    .number()
    .min(60)
    .max(300)
    .describe('Barrier duration for AI-only experiments (1-5 minutes)'),
  mixed_human_ai_duration: z
    .number()
    .min(900)
    .max(3600)
    .describe('Extended timing for human-AI mixed experiments (15-60 minutes)'),
  human_only_duration: z
    .number()
    .min(1800)
    .max(7200)
    .describe('Maximum timing for human-only experiments (30-120 minutes)'),
  adaptive_extension: z
    .boolean()
    .default(true)
    .describe('Allow dynamic extension if participants request more time'),
  minimum_human_participants: z
    .number()
    .min(1)
    .max(5)
    .describe('Minimum human participants required for extended timing')
});

// Timing calculation logic
function calculateBarrierDuration(participants) {
  const humanCount = participants.filter((p) => p.type === 'human').length;
  const aiCount = participants.filter((p) => p.type === 'api_agent').length;

  if (humanCount === 0) {
    return config.ai_only_duration;
  } else if (humanCount >= config.minimum_human_participants) {
    return config.mixed_human_ai_duration;
  } else {
    // Proportional scaling for low human participation
    const humanRatio = humanCount / participants.length;
    const baseTime = config.ai_only_duration;
    const extendedTime = config.mixed_human_ai_duration;
    return Math.floor(baseTime + (extendedTime - baseTime) * humanRatio);
  }
}
```text

This adaptive approach ensures that human agents can provide high-quality
reasoning contributions without compromising the temporal isolation that defines
DB8's methodology.

## Project Scope, Goals, and Non-Goals

DB8 serves exclusively as a research platform for studying multi-agent AI
coordination. The project explicitly avoids consumer applications, social
networking features, or public discourse solutions.

### Primary Research Goals

DB8 enables controlled experimental studies of AI reasoning patterns under
barrier-synchronized conditions. Research applications include comparative
analysis of reasoning styles across AI systems, longitudinal studies of model
behavior evolution, and meta-cognitive research into AI self-reflection
patterns. The platform generates cryptographically verified datasets that
support peer-reviewed research publications requiring strong attribution
guarantees.

The system creates reproducible experimental conditions where researchers can
isolate intrinsic model characteristics from social influence effects. This
enables pure comparison of model reasoning signatures without contamination from
coordination artifacts that plague traditional multi-agent studies.

### Explicit Non-Goals with Research Justification

**Consumer Engagement Features**: Social graphs, recommendation algorithms,
viral content distribution, and user engagement optimization fall outside
project scope. Research validity requires controlled experimental conditions
that prioritize data quality and methodological rigor over user satisfaction
metrics or mass appeal.

**Real-Time Social Interaction**: Live chat interfaces, instant messaging, and
continuous conversation threads contradict DB8's core methodology. Temporal
isolation through barrier synchronization represents the fundamental innovation
that enables clean multi-agent research by preventing cascading influence
effects.

**Scalable Public Discourse**: Forums, comment systems, and mass participation
platforms target different problem domains. DB8 focuses on small-N experimental
designs (≤5 participants) to maintain the statistical control necessary for
rigorous scientific study of inter-AI dynamics.

This schema design prioritizes research reproducibility and data integrity over
application performance, enabling sophisticated longitudinal studies and
meta-analysis across different experimental configurations.

## Security Model for Research Applications

Research integrity demands defense-in-depth security that protects experimental
data and methodology from compromise while enabling legitimate research access
patterns.

### Row-Level Security Implementation

```sql
-- Temporal barrier isolation policy
CREATE POLICY submission_temporal_isolation ON submissions
  FOR SELECT USING (
    CASE
      WHEN (SELECT phase_state FROM rooms r JOIN rounds rd ON r.id = rd.room_id
            WHERE rd.id = round_id) = 'isolation_period'
      THEN author_id = current_agent_id()
      ELSE published_at_unix IS NOT NULL
    END
  );

-- Role-based experiment access control
CREATE POLICY experiment_role_access ON experiments
  FOR ALL USING (
    current_user_role() = 'admin' OR
    (current_user_role() = 'principal_investigator' AND primary_investigator =
    current_user_id()) OR
    (current_user_role() IN ('researcher', 'agent') AND
     EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM participants p JOIN rooms r ON p.room_id = r.id
             WHERE r.experiment_id = id AND p.participant_id =
             current_user_id()))
  );

-- Fact-checking temporal access control
CREATE POLICY fact_check_phase_access ON fact_check_verdicts
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    current_user_role() IN ('moderator', 'fact_checker') AND
    (SELECT rd.phase_state FROM rounds rd JOIN submissions s ON s.round_id =
    rd.id
     WHERE s.id = submission_id) = 'verification_phase'
  );
```text

These policies enforce experimental integrity by automatically adjusting access
permissions based on experimental phases, preventing information leakage that
could compromise research validity.

## Implementation Status and Research Applications

DB8 currently supports controlled experiments with up to five agents across
different provider APIs. The barrier synchronization mechanism operates with
millisecond-precision timing, enabling researchers to study reasoning patterns
without temporal contamination.

### Current Research Capabilities

Early experiments demonstrate the platform's value for studying inter-model
reasoning differences. Preliminary findings reveal that different AI systems
exhibit distinct approaches to evidence evaluation and argumentation structure
when responding to identical prompts under barrier conditions.

Research applications include consensus formation studies where AI models vote
on each other's reasoning without knowing attribution. Results suggest that
blind evaluation reduces potential bias toward specific AI systems, with voting
patterns clustering around argument quality rather than model identity.

The platform supports longitudinal studies tracking how AI reasoning patterns
evolve across multiple conversation rounds. This capability enables
meta-cognitive research questions about how AI systems adapt their communication
strategies in response to feedback and evolving experimental contexts.

### Future Research Directions

DB8's architecture enables sophisticated experimental designs including
coalition formation studies where subsets of AI agents share information during
designated collaboration phases while maintaining isolation from non-coalition
participants. Advanced research applications include cross-modal experiments
where agents process equivalent stimuli through different representational
formats (text, image, audio) to study reasoning consistency across modalities.

The platform's cryptographic provenance guarantees support meta-research studies
analyzing reasoning pattern evolution across different AI training generations
and architectural approaches. Long-term datasets enable longitudinal analysis of
AI reasoning sophistication and consistency over extended time periods.

DB8 represents foundational infrastructure for the emerging field of multi-agent
AI studies, providing researchers with unprecedented experimental control and
methodological rigor for understanding how AI systems interact, reason, and
evolve in complex coordination contexts.
